# ðŸ§  Cluster Inspector Operator

A Kubernetes Operator built with Kubebuilder that uses an AI model (via [Ollama](https://ollama.com)) to run periodic inspections on your cluster. It evaluates system status, pod behavior, and more to provide intelligent summaries and recommendations.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Custom resource `InspectionReport` to trigger inspections
- Periodic re-evaluation using controller requeue
- AI-powered analysis using a local Ollama model (e.g., `llama3`)
- Extendable to include logs, events, and metrics
